# How to display detail views under each other


<p>By default, the grid displays detail views on tab pages. If there are several child views at the same level, only one can be seen at a time - the one that appears on the selected detail tab.</p><p>You may wish to add an additional level (GridView) to display a list of relations and allow a user to expand them, to see the actual detail under one other. This example demonstrates how to implement this feature by handling the MasterRow~ events.</p>
